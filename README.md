## Overview

I started studying at [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en/) in October 2022 and the plan is to finish Core Curriculum before October 2024.

## Core Curriculum

My curriculum consists of 7 ranks (numbered 0-6) with projects of increasing difficulty. Ranks 0-3 are pure C, on the following ranks C++ is introduced and the last big project on the last rank is modern web technologies.

Note, that the school uses peer-to-peer learning, it means we have no lectures or any studying materials except for project subjects (they tell what to do but not how).

Here is the list of my projects so far:

rnk | Name + link | Description | Status | readme
-|-|-|-|-
0 | [libft](https://github.com/Oktosha/codam-libft) | implement own versions of some libc functions (strlen, atoi, ...) | ✅ | 😐
1 | [printf](https://github.com/Oktosha/codam-printf) | implement a subset of printf | ✅  | 😐
1 | [get_next_line](https://github.com/Oktosha/codam-get_next_line) | write a function that reads next line from a file descriptor | ✅  | 😐
1 | [born2beroot](https://github.com/Oktosha/codam-born2beroot) | set up a virtual machine | ✅ | 😐
2 | [so_long](https://github.com/Oktosha/codam-so_long) | build 2D-game with simple graphics library | ✅ | ✅
2 | [mintalk](https://github.com/Oktosha/codam-minitalk) | make processes exchange messages using signals | ✅ | 😐
2 | [push_swap](https://github.com/Oktosha/codam-push_swap) | build a sorting algo on unusual execution model | ✅ | 🤨
3 | [minishell](https://github.com/Oktosha/codam-minishell) | build a subset of bash | ⌛ | ❌


## 📚 Further Reading

This repo is about things I do at [Codam](https://codam.nl/en). I do some out-of-school coding, too. If you want the up-to-date info on my projects, got to my [github profile](https://github.com/Oktosha). At the moment of writing, I'm proud of the following:

+ [Advent of Code 2022 participation](https://github.com/Oktosha/aoc-2022): all stars gathered and I learned Kotlin!
+ [Raytracing in C++17 wrapped with Cython](https://github.com/Oktosha/ray-tracing): done in 2019 (hence the standard version choice) and it is mostly just another completion of [a very enjoyable tutorial](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley. The twist is that raytracing code is wrapped into a python module that can be used from Jupyter notebook. It was my first time wrapping C++ with Python and for me crossing the boundary between languages felt kinda magical. I guess that's why I'm so attached to this project even though no-one stars it (at the moment of writing)
+ The fact that I can still attest [my blue color](https://codeforces.com/profile/Dashk0) on Codeforeces

If you think we can collaborate, don't hesitate to contact me in some way listed on [my github profile page](https://github.com/Oktosha) or via [this form](https://forms.gle/GCa9ymrYwtTzgiCS8).
